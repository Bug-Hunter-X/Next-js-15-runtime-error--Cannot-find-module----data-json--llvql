# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Cannot find module './data.json'

This repository demonstrates a runtime error in Next.js 15 when importing a JSON file in a dynamic route.  The error occurs because the `require()` statement in `pages/about.js` attempts to access a file (`data.json`) which is not correctly resolved by the Next.js build process within this specific folder structure.  This bug highlights a potential unexpected behavior when working with JSON imports within the context of dynamic pages or routes. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the runtime error in the browser's console.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to correctly import the JSON data using the `next/dynamic` feature for dynamic imports in Next.js.  This strategy enables improved error handling and code management.
